                        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 30px; align: left;">
                           Hello! My name is Gaston Jarju, pronounced as “Gas-tin”.I am currently in my final year at Berea college, Kentucky, pursuing a Computer Science major
                           and a minor in Business Administration.
                           At my college, I participate in the Labor Program as a student photographer, where I specialize in portrait photography, including
                           studio portraits and outdoor event photography.The images I capture connect the college to the outside audience like alumni, donors, prospective
                           students, and other key stakeholders.
                          </p>
                          <p style="color: black; text-indent: 30px; align: left;">
                          Outside college photography, I love to go to locations and shoot street and infrastructure photography. I am also open to working with other photographers and models, so
                          please don't hesitate to get in touch with me to discuss your photography wishes.
                            </p>

                    <p>I am an international student from The Gambia, West Africa. Apart from academia and photography,
                      I love working out at the gym or watching soccer. Gym workout is both therapeutic and a way to stay healthy for me.
                      A fun fact about me would be taking a trip to the city of Manchester, United Kingdom, just to watch Manchester United play soccer.
                      My love for soccer is unreal.</p>
