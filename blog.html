                           Hello! My name is Gaston Jarju.I am currently in my final year at Berea college, Kentucky, pursuing a Computer Science major
                           and a minor in Business Administration.
                           At my college, I participate in the Labor Program as a student photographer, where I specialize in portrait photography, including
                           studio portraits and outdoor event photography.The images I capture connect the college to the outside audience like alumni, donors, prospective
                           students, and other key stakeholders.
                          </p>

                    <p style="color: black; text-indent: 30px; align: left;">I ventured into photography with the sole goal to embrace and improve my inner creativity. But here I am, more than a year later, still passionately practicing photography
                     and it doesn’t seem to end anytime soon.Personally, by practicing the art of photography every day, I’ve come to see the world differently. It has also changed my perception
                     of what in life is important and worthwhile.</p>
                    <p style="color: black; text-indent: 30px; align: left;">There is beauty in the little things. I am glad that I took that leap to explore the field of photography because by recording
                     the happiest moments of my audience, I spend more time thinking about the good things. Never limit yourself to what life is seemingly offering to you. There is more in this
                     world to find a solace. Photography has given me that solace!</p>
                     <div><p style="color: black; text-indent: 30px; align: left;">
                     Outside college photography, I love to go to locations and shoot street and infrastructure photography. I am also open to working with other photographers and models, so
                     please don't hesitate to get in touch with me to discuss your photography wishes.</p></div><br><br><br>

                    <p>I am an international student from The Gambia, West Africa. Apart from academia and photography,
                      I love working out at the gym or watching soccer. Gym workout is both therapeutic and a way to stay healthy for me.
                      A fun fact about me is, I would love to take a trip to Manchester, United Kingdom, to watch Manchester United play soccer. My love for soccer is unreal.</p>
