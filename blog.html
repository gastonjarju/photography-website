                    <p>I am an international student from The Gambia, West Africa. I
                      am currently a senior pursuing a Computer Science major and a minor in Business
                      Administration at Berea College, Kentucky. At Berea College, I work as a
                      student photographer with the Marketing and Communication department,
                      where my team is involved in the production of images and art for the college.
                      We capture fitting images of students, staff, faculties, and events of the college.
                      These images connect the college to the outside audience like alumni, donors, prospective
                      students, and other key stakeholders.</p>
