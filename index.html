                    <p style="color: black; text-indent: 30px; align: left;">
                      I enjoy working with other newbie photographers as well as professional photographers.
                      Working with different photographers helps me to learn new things daily. Since
                      I started my photography journey, I have always learned a thing or two whenever
                      I collaborate with another photographer. Teamwork is very essential in photography.

                    <p>I am an international student from The Gambia, West Africa. I
                      am currently a senior pursuing a Computer Science major and a minor in Business
                      Administration at Berea College, Kentucky. At Berea College, I work as a
                      student photographer with the Marketing and Communication department,
                      where my team is involved in the production of images and art for the college.
                      We capture fitting images of students, staff, faculties, and events of the college.
                      These images connect the college to the outside audience like alumni, donors, prospective
                      students, and other key stakeholders.</p>
