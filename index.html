                    <p style="color: black; text-indent: 30px; align: left;">
                      I enjoy working with other student photographers as well as professional photographers.
                      Working with different photographers is a mutual benefit. By collaborating with other photographers,
                      I get to learn, improve myself, and help others as well. It is a very healthy and creative way to inspire
                      and be inspired while working on something atypical. Since I started my photography journey,
                      it has always been a great time when I work with other photographers.

                    <p>I am an international student from The Gambia, West Africa. Apart from academia and photography,
                      I love working out at the gym or watching soccer. Gym workout is both therapeutic and a way to stay healthy for me.
                      A fun fact about me would be taking a trip to the city of Manchester, United Kingdom, just to watch Manchester United play soccer.
                      My love for soccer is unreal.</p>
